      Gaming just got real. With graphics powered by your PS5, the VR2 headset pulls you into a different world.
      It uses
      two
      4K OLED displays to fill your field of view with sharp, vibrant images. And they run at up to 120 Hz refresh
      rate
      for
      super smooth and realistic motion. That's sharp and smooth enough to make you forget about the outside
      world. But,
      to
      draw you even further in, there's Tempest 3D audio that'll put planes over your head and creepers behind
      your
      back. And
      the included VR2 Sense controllers have the excellent haptic feedback you're used to from your PS5's
      controllers.
      Put it
      all together and it'll look, sound and feel like you're in the game.
